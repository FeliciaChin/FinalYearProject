# Final Year Project
### Project Title: Text Classification for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Symptoms and Treatments Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

### Academic Session: 2023/2024
### Student: Felicia Chin Hui Fen (A20EC0037)
### Program: Bachelor Of Computer Science (Bioinformatics)
### Supervisor: Dr Sharin Hazlin Binti Hupsi
### Co-Supervisor: Dr Ahmad Najmi Bin Amerhaider Nuar

### Summary:
This document holds all the coding for the final year project text classification for major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms and treatments using convolutional neural networks (CNN), which include all process and functions used to analyse the dataset, building the model, evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and classifying the MDDsymptoms and treatments words from medical journals. The issues of classifying the MDDsymptoms and treatments from text data (medical journals) can be solved.
